# Rusty-Framework Agent Instructions

## Verify

Rusty-Framework uses a hybrid Rust/Node frontend stack. Always verify both sides:

cargo test --workspace

cargo fmt --all

**Note:** Rust formatting is enforced on pre-commit via `.husky/pre-commit`. Staged `.rs` files are auto-formatted with `rustfmt --edition 2021 --config skip_children=true` and re-added. Partially staged files are checked only and will block the commit if unformatted.

## Lint
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings

## Frontend (src/frontend)
Vite+ toolchain, pnpm@10.33.0. Always `pnpm run <script>` or `pnpm exec vp` —
a globally installed `vp` may be an older version and `vp migrate` would
downgrade the project config.

CI runs these three, from `src/frontend`, after `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`:

pnpm lint --max-warnings=0
pnpm exec tsc -b
pnpm test

`vite-plus`, `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-core` (aliased as `vite`) and `vitest` are
grouped in `renovate.json` as the "vite-plus toolchain" so they bump together:
`vite-plus` pins `vitest` exactly, so a partial bump desynchronizes the
toolchain. Five entries carry them — `devDependencies.vite`,
`devDependencies.vite-plus`, `devDependencies.vitest`, `pnpm.overrides.vite` and
`pnpm.overrides.vitest` — and all five must move to the same versions in one
change. Renovate does this automatically once its GitHub App is installed on the
repo; until then, keep them in lockstep by hand.
